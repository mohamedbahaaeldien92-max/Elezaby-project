        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Exact Match Recovery:** The initial recovery phase, which involved an exact match merge using `cleaned_product_id` and `product_id` from the reference data, successfully recovered 36,617 product IDs.\n",
        "*   **Prefix and Price Match Recovery:** For the IDs not recovered in the first stage, a second stage using a prefix (first 6 digits) and price match (within a \\$\\pm\\$0.001 tolerance) was performed, increasing the total number of recovered IDs to 54,904.\n",
        "*   **Validation Impact:** A strict validation process, checking for existence in `order_products_df`, string type, digit-only content, absence of scientific notation or '.0' suffix, and a length between 6 and 13 digits, resulted in a significant decrease in valid recoveries. After validation, only 34,982 product IDs remained successfully recovered.\n",
        "*   **Corrupted IDs and Recovery Failure:** Out of a total of 62,700 products, 27,718 were identified as initially having corrupted or malformed `product_id` values. This number precisely matches the count of products that ultimately failed to be recovered after all stages and validation, indicating that initial data quality issues were the primary cause of recovery failures.\n",
        "*   **Overall Recovery Outcome:** The final process yielded 34,982 successfully recovered product IDs, and 27,718 failed recoveries, resulting in an overall recovery success rate of 55.79%.\n",
        "*   **Output Files:** Two CSV files were generated: \"products_dimension_recovered.csv\" containing the 34,982 successfully recovered products and \"products_dimension_failed.csv\" with the 27,718 unrecovered products.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The significant drop in recovered IDs after validation (from 54,904 to 34,982) suggests that many product IDs initially identified by the recovery algorithms did not meet the stringent data quality requirements. This highlights the importance of comprehensive validation in data cleaning processes.\n",
        "*   Given that the number of initially corrupted product IDs (27,718) exactly matches the number of failed recoveries, future efforts could focus on identifying and correcting the root causes of these corruptions in the source data to improve overall data quality and recovery rates.\n"
